- A clear and concise description of the enhancement
- Why you think this enhancement would be valuable
- Any potential alternatives you’ve considered

### Submitting Code Changes

We welcome code contributions! If you’d like to submit a change or feature, please fork the repository and create a pull request (PR). When submitting code changes, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Create a new branch** for your work (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. **Make your changes**, ensuring you follow the style guide and coding conventions.
4. **Write tests** if your change involves functionality.
5. **Commit your changes** with a clear, descriptive commit message.
6. **Push your branch** to your forked repository (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
7. **Open a pull request** against the main repository’s `main` branch.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # For JavaScript/Node.js projects:
   npm install

   # For Python projects:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. For any additional setup instructions (e.g., environment variables, databases), refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory or the project’s setup guide.

## Branching Strategy

We use Git flow to manage our branching strategy. Here are the key branches:

- `main`: The main branch with stable and production-ready code.
- `develop`: The development branch where new features and bug fixes are merged.
- `feature/<feature-name>`: Feature branches created from `develop` for new features.
- `hotfix/<bug-name>`: Hotfix branches created from `main` for urgent fixes.

When working on a new feature or bug fix, always branch off from `develop`.

## Style Guide

Please adhere to the following style guidelines when contributing:

- Use **camelCase** for variables and function names.
- Write **clear and descriptive commit messages**. Follow this format:
  ```
  [TYPE] short description of changes

  - Bullet points of what was changed.
  - Any additional details or context.
  ```
  Example: 
  ```
  [Fix] Corrected typo in README file

  - Fixed spelling error in "Contributers" section
  ```

- Follow the project's coding conventions (e.g., indentation, line length). If unsure, follow the existing code style.

## Running Tests

Before submitting your PR, ensure all tests are passing. To run tests, follow the steps below:

- **For JavaScript/Node.js projects**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
  
- **For Python projects**:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

If you’re adding new features or fixing bugs, please add or update tests as needed.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch of the project.
2. Include a clear description of your changes.
3. If the pull request addresses an issue, reference the issue number (e.g., `Closes #123`).
4. Wait for feedback from the maintainers. Be open to suggestions and requests for changes.
5. Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into `main`.
